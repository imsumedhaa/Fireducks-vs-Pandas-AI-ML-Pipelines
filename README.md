# 🤖 AI & ML Pipelines: Tackling Data Challenges with FireDucks

A practical guide and benchmark showcasing how **FireDucks** enhances performance in AI & Data Science workflows by replacing slow, memory-heavy data handling steps.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Modern AI/ML pipelines often suffer bottlenecks during data ingestion, transformation, and exploratory analysis — especially with large datasets. Traditional tools like Pandas can slow down experimentation. This project explores how **FireDucks**, a high-performance Pandas alternative, streamlines these stages.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

AI/ML workflows face 3 major data challenges:
- 🚫 Slow data loading and filtering for large datasets (10M+ rows)
- 🧠 High memory usage during preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🐢 Latency in EDA, impacting model iteration speed

---

## ✅ Solution

Use **FireDucks** to accelerate every data step:
- Drop-in replacement for Pandas
- Supports lazy evaluation
- Optimized for speed & memory
- Ideal for EDA, preprocessing, and large-scale data pipelines

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- FireDucks
- Pandas (for baseline)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Time module for benchmarking

---

## ⚙️ Key Pipeline Steps

1. **Load 10M+ Row Dataset** (CSV)
2. **Filter Rows** (e.g., price > 100)
3. **Group & Aggregate**
4. **Visualize Trends**
5. **Benchmark each step**
