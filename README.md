# ðŸš€ FireDucks vs Pandas: Speeding Up AI/ML Pipelines

A quick benchmark comparing **FireDucks** with **Pandas** for common data tasks in machine learning workflows â€” like reading, filtering, grouping, and sorting large datasets.

## âš¡ Why FireDucks?

Pandas is great, but it struggles with big data. **FireDucks** is a drop-in replacement built for performance:

* Faster execution (especially on large datasets)
* Lazy evaluation for better optimization
* Lower memory usage
* Same Pandas-like syntax
